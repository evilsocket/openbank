# OpenBank

OpenBank is a Laravel based web application that you can use to keep track of your BitCoin public keys, your total balance and so forth.
All the data is collected in realtime and will be shown to you on its web interface.

### Screenshot

This is a screenshot of my instance running on a Raspberry Pi.

### Safe

The database only stores the password you're using to access your OpenBank instance and your public keys, **no sensitive data will be leaked even if compromised**.
Moreover if you install it on a Raspberry Pi running on your home network, you won't leak your ip address to a third entity.

### How does it work

All data is updated in realtime using two different API, one job will get the current price every minute using the [bitcoinaverage.com](https//bitcoinaverage.com/) API while your total balance is updated using the [blockonomics.co](https://www.blockonomics.co/) API.

**IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT XPUB**

If you're adding an **xPub** key with more than 50 addresses bound to it, you'll need to get an API key from blockonomics and put it in your settings panel. Make sure you add **all** your addresses/keys to the wallet watcher service or else it will appear with 0 balance.
